It defines the principles, responsibilities, and requirements for protecting organizational
information assets against threats and vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third parties
- All information systems and data
- All physical and digital assets

## Security Principles

Our information security program is built on three core principles:

        I[Integrity]
        A[Availability]
    end
    
    C --> |Protect sensitive data| Controls
    I --> |Ensure accuracy| Controls
    A --> |Maintain access| Controls
    Controls --> SecurityProgram[Security Program]
```

### Confidentiality
Information must be protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.

### Integrity
Information must be accurate, complete, and protected from unauthorized modification.

### Availability
Information must be accessible to authorized users when needed.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Security Team | Implement and monitor security controls |
| IT Department | Maintain technical security measures |

## Access Control

Access to information systems must follow the principle of **least privilege**:

1. Access is granted based on business need
2. Access rights are regularly reviewed
3. Access is revoked upon role change or termination
4. Multi-factor authentication is required for sensitive systems

## Data Classification

All organizational data must be classified according to sensitivity:

- **Public**: Can be shared externally
- **Internal**: For internal use only
- **Confidential**: Restricted access, business-sensitive
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive, legal/compliance requirements

## Incident Response

Security incidents must be reported immediately to the Security Team:
